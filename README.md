# hello-world
This is my first repository, testing.
Hi,
My name is John. I am clearly new to Github and am wanting to learn everything at a rate that might seem crazy!
I am a self motivated individual looking to increase my skills in programming.
At current my level is what most would consider a newb, and rightfully so. 
I want to learn and am practicing daily, I can't wait for the time to come where this all feels as its second nature to me.

I'd like to practice more every day. I would like to continue until I get a job as a programmer.
